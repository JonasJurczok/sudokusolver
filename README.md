This program is intended as a coding practice.. also I always wanted to test random Sudoku solving strategies.

## Current state

I'm currently working on the UI to present the Sudoku and allow the user to select a strategy and observe the solving of the puzzle.

## Try yourself

To run the application clone the repository. Then execute

````
mvn clean verify
````

followed by

````
java -jar target\Sudokusolver.jar-jar-with-dependencies.jar
````
